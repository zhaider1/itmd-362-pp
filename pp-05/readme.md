# Production Problem 05: Usability Checklists

## The Problem

Usability checklists are typical, and sometimes mindless, tools/magic tricks used to find usability
problems in web and other digital projects. What you are going to do for this Production Problem is
to locate at least 2 different usability checklists each containing at least 25 items (use Google,
but challenge yourself to go beyond the first page of results). From those lists, create your own,
condensed list of exactly ten items.

Share with your group for Project 3 to help yourselves create
your own master usability checklist.

## Deliverables

* Your own condensed, ten-item must-have usability checklist:

1. Pages aren't cluttered.
2. Styles and Colors consistent
3. Site can be navigated without a mouse(Accessible navigation menus)
4. Form simplicity. Only absolutely necessary questions are asked in forms.
5. Font size easy to read
6. Browser compatibility
7. Navigation is consistent on every page.
8. Form submission is confirmed, so that the user knows data was successfully sent
9. Links are descriptive. There are no "click here" links.  
10. Links, buttons and checkboxes are easily clickable, for example a user can select a checkbox by clicking the text, not just the checkbox.
